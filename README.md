# Project-1
This repo contains project done by me in the course of tools in data science which is part of BSC degree in Programming and Data Science from IIT Madras.

Project-1:
Scraping Data:
To obtain user data from GitHub, utilized the GitHub API. started by creating a personal access token for authentication. Using the GitHub Search API,requested to find users in Beijing with over 500 followers. The request returned a JSON response, from which I extracted relevant fields such as username, name, company, location, email, and others. The obtained data is converted into a csv excel file using python programming and libraries such as numpy and pandas.After cleaning the data to ensure proper formatting Data analysis is performed using these lbraries and excel tool is maually used to analyze the data.
Performed the data analysis manually by using excel and alo using python libraries.



Most interesting suprising fact:
After analyzing the collected data, one of the most striking observations was the remarkable level of engagement among users with substantial follower counts. It became evident that a large number of followers often correlated with a high degree of activity on the platform.

An actionable recommendation for developers based on your analysis:


A Recommendation for Developers
Based on what I discovered, Iâ€™d like to recommend that developers, especially beginners, take advantage of networking opportunities.The two points that i would like to suggest are:
1)Follow Influential Developers: Connect with those who have a strong presence on GitHub. One can learn so much from the work and insights of the established develpers
2)Get Involved in Open Source Projects: Contributing to projects led by well-known developers builds your skills and also boosts visibility in the community.
