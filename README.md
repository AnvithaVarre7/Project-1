# Project-1
This repo contains project done by me in the course of tools in data science which is part of BSC degree in Programming and Data Science from IIT Madras.
Project-1:
. Performed the data analysis using excel and these libraries.To obtain user data from GitHub, I utilized the GitHub API. I started by creating a personal access token for authentication. Using the GitHub Search API,requested to find users in Beijing with over 500 followers. The request returned a JSON response, from which I extracted relevant fields such as username, name, company, location, email, and others. 
The obtained data is converted into a csv excel file using python programming and libraries such as numpy and pandas.After cleaning the data to ensure proper formatting Data analysis is performed using these lbraries and excel tool is maually used to analyze the data.

Most interesting suprising fact:
After analyzing the collected data, one of the most striking observations was the remarkable level of engagement among users with substantial follower counts. It became evident that a large number of followers often correlated with a high degree of activity on the platform.

An actionable recommendation for developers based on your analysis:
Developers should leverage networking opportunities by following and engaging with influential users on GitHub. This can be done by:

Collaborating on Open Source Projects to enhance visibility and gain experience.
Attending Local Meetups to network with established developers and explore mentorship opportunities.
By actively engaging with the community, developers can significantly enhance their skills and professional connections.
